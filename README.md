An active archive of computer art.

This repo aims to resurrect forgotten works of computer art and port them to a language that is widely used, easily accessibly to beginners, and advanced enough to build upon the original artworks to create new ones. For these reasons, we have chosen Processing as the common language for this project due to its widespread use (particularly in educational environments), extensive documentation, and active community of developers and contributors.

FAQ's
-----
Q: Do I have to use GitHub to participate?  
A: Yes
	
Q: Are you or other people on this repo going to steal my work?  
A: Yes, but let's not call it stealing. All work on the site is covered under a Creative
Commons license that ensures the original creator will be credited if his/her code is reused. The more we share, the more possibilities for good artwork there are.
	
Q: Where did you find this stuff?  
A: Rhizome.org posted these pdfs, which were originally published by compart (dada.compart-bremen.de)
	
Q: Are you going to do more of this?  
A: Yes. This is a first round that we hope will reveal ways to improve the project. After the hackathon event we will begin a round of research to find some really awesome retro computer art, hopefully with more original code.
	
Q: Can I help?  
A: Sure! Send us stuff you'd like to see translated. [primary email TBA]
	
Q: Who are you?  
A: I'm Matt. I'm a graduate student at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. 
Kyle McDonald is an advisor on the project and a core contributor.
